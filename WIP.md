# Work In Progress (WIP) - Agent Coordination File

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-24
**Lead Agent**: Agent 1 (has tie-breaking authority)

## Agent Roles & Authority

### Agent 1 (Lead - Backend/Infrastructure Focus)

- **Authority**: Tie-breaking power on technical decisions
- **Primary Domain**: Backend, APIs, Database, Core Logic, Backend Tests
- **Secondary**: Can assist with any task when other agents need help

### Agent 2 (Frontend/UI Focus)

- **Primary Domain**: UI Components, Pages, User Experience, Frontend Tests
- **Secondary**: Can assist with API integration and testing

### Agent 3 (Documentation & Testing Focus)

## Communication Protocol

1. **Task Assignment**: Mark tasks with agent ownership below
2. **Blockers**: Use BLOCKED tag with description
3. **Handoffs**: Use READY_FOR tag when passing work
4. **Decisions**: Agent 1 has final say on conflicts

## Task Queue

### Ready for Development

- [ ] Time utility functions (/core/time.ts)
- [ ] Opening hours validator (/core/opening-hours.ts)
- [ ] Slot enumeration logic (/core/slots.ts)
- [x] Prisma client singleton (/lib/db.ts) - COMPLETED by Agent 1
- [ ] Replace mock auth with database queries (lib/auth/mock-users.ts) - TODO after quickstart
- [ ] Run quickstart script to initialize database - IMPORTANT: Use `npm run quickstart`

### Blocked/Waiting

- [ ] Availability API - BLOCKED: Needs core utilities
- [ ] Booking creation API - BLOCKED: Needs database setup
- [ ] UI Components - BLOCKED: Needs base project setup

## Room ID System Proposal (Agent 2 ‚Üí Agent 1)

### Proposed Room Identification

- **Room IDs**: Use format `{SITE_CODE}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., SFO-001, NYC-002)
- **Site Codes**:
  - San Francisco ‚Üí SFO
  - New York ‚Üí NYC
  - London ‚Üí LON
  - Shanghai ‚Üí SHA
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy to identify site from room ID
  - Sortable and searchable
  - User-friendly display as "Oak (SFO-001)"
- **Implementation**: Created `lib/room-utils.ts` with helper functions

## Integration Points

### API Contracts to Define

1. **GET /api/availability**
   - Request: sites[], capacityMin, dates, timeWindow
   - Response: Room[] with slot availability

2. **POST /api/bookings**
   - Request: roomId, startLocal, endLocal, attendees[]
   - Response: Booking with ID

3. **DELETE /api/bookings/[id]**
   - Response: Success/Error

### Shared Types Needed

```typescript
// /types/index.ts
interface TimeSlot {
  startUtc: Date
  endUtc: Date
  available: boolean
}

interface RoomAvailability {
  room: Room
  slots: TimeSlot[]
}
```

## Decision Log

| Date       | Decision                         | Made By | Rationale                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 2025-09-24 | Use server actions for mutations | Agent 1 | Better DX with Next.js 14 |
| 2025-09-24 | Tailwind for styling             | Both    | Rapid development         |
